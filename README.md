# Etch-a-sketch!

As I'm reaching the end of Foundations Course from The Odin Project, I realize how great this was as an exercise to review many of skills and implement new learnings. I'm trying to stick with simpler projects, but efficient and based on best practices for each stack, allowing me to move on to some more complex topics in this "bootcamp".

This project specifically was really great to put to practice some Math skills, problems regarding the input of the user, loops and event-listeners.

You can check it's deploy on: https://jvkf.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/
